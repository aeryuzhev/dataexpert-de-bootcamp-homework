**Pipeline Ownership:**

| Pipeline Name                     | Primary Owner | Secondary Owner |
|------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Unit-level Profit for Experiments | DE1           | DE2            |

**On-Call Schedule:**

* **Rotation:** Weekly rotation among all team members (DE1 -> DE2 -> DE3 -> DE4 -> DE1, etc.)
* **Holidays:**
    * If a team member is on-call during a holiday, they can arrange a swap with another team member in advance.
    * If no swap is possible, the on-call engineer will have reduced responsibilities during the holiday period. 
* **Communication:** On-call responsibilities and contact information will be clearly documented and shared with the team.
